00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:06,088
画外音：本片故事既非要谴责战争，也不是内心忏悔

-6
00:00:06,543 --> 00:00:09,088
更不是描述一次冒险

-5
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,088
对那些面对过死亡的人来说，战争决不仅仅是冒险

00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:16,088

他们进攻我们的战壕，我们也进攻他们的
They attack our trench.We attack their trench.

然后为了不吃亏，他们还会再来进攻我们的

-好啊，这个习惯不好

95
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,746
(Horse whinnies)

96
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,582
(Yawns)

97
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,212
If you could get enough sleep,it wouldn't be a bad little war.

98
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,173

- If you could get enough food.- If you could get enough women.

99
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,560
Come on, Heinrich, open up, we're hungry.

103
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,532
and I don't serve until the rest of you get here.

104
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,410
The rest are either in the dressing station or pushing up the daisies!

105
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,080
Well, I've cooked for 150 men.

106
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,708
Ah! So then we'll all have enough.For once!

107
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,461
- You've got bread for 150 men?- Yeah.

108
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,755

- Yeah, but...- Good, let's have it!

110
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,927
So let's see, that's enough bread for er...

00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,846
Double portions!

112
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,098
Is that right? Double!

113
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,601
I can only issue rations to 80 men.

114
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,728
Here's Lieutenant Bertinck.

115
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,189
The beans smell delicious, Sergeant.

116
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,566
Thank you, sir.

117
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,365
It would be nice to see this once in a while at the front.
Eh, Katczinsky?

118
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,368
Yes, sir! That's right, sir.

119

121
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,545
- Come on, belly robber, you heard him.- Yeah, but he didn't say...

122
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,840
Look, you... We are the Second Company.

123
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,301
You are the cook for the Second Company.

124
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,930
You didn't make food for 80 men,you made food for the Second Company.

125
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,475
And we, damn you,we are the Second Company!

126
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,020
Well, it isn't right.

127
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,688
Come on!

128
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,399
Come on, stop cheating.

129
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:07,113
It's not right. There should be a system.

130
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,620
It's not right. I cook all this food... (Muttering)

131
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,288

Every one of us has eaten for two men and the mail has come.

绿色的小草摇动着，仿佛是一柄长矛
The grasses sway like tall spears.

135
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:37,602
白色的蝴蝶在柔软的风中飘舞

136
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,066
在过去的几天中，我们一再面临死亡的威胁
How often in the Iast few days have we come to the edge of death?

137
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,234
不过不要再想这些了
Let's not even think about it.

138
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,779
还是尽情地享受这个世界吧
Let's just enjoy the world.

139
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,448

Everything is new and brave.

142
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,182
(Laughter)

143
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,539
(Man) Paul? Paul?

144
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,877
我们去看堪布里希吧
We're going to see Kemmerich.

145
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,738

146
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,949
请问，佛兰兹·堪布里希在哪儿？

150
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,024
有人偷了我的手表
(Whispers) Someone stole my watch.

151
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,526
-狗东西！-我提醒过你
- Bastards!- I warned you, Franz.

152
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,446
-我知道。-你最好告诉医生
- I know.- (Paul) We'll tell the doctor.

153
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,034
你就要回家啦
You'll be going home soon.

154
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,368
这是真的吗？
(Franz) Do you think?

155
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,996
-是的。-你气色不错，佛兰兹
- Any day.- You look fine, Franz.

156
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,416
我感觉…没什么事
(Franz) I feel... I'm all right.

157
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,756
我的脚，特别的疼
My foot. It's so painful.

158
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,593
我感觉很冷
It's so cold.

159
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,179
这是回家的车票
That pain is your ticket home.

160
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,015
不要紧的，你应该为此感到欣慰才是啊
You should be grateful to that pain.

161
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,520
再过一周，你就能抽上香烟，坐在教堂的前廊里
In a week you'll be smoking cigars on Frau Hammerschmidt's front porch,

162
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,397
和别人在一起谈天说地了
telling big fat lies to Katrine Hammerschmidt.

163
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,652
我们给你带来了烟，还有一块奶酪，还有凯特的祝福
We got you some smokes and a piece of cheese from Kat,

164
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,821
你的梳子在香烟盒里放着呢
and your comb is in the tobacco tin.

165
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,783
请把它们放在床底下
Put them under the bed, please.

166
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,829
藏起来。要知道，有人偷了我的手表
Hide them.You know they stole my watch.

167
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:51,129
佛兰兹，你打算把这个带回家吗？
Franz, will you be taking these back home with you?

168
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,090
当然了
Why not?

169
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,551
你在家里用不上靴子
Well, you don't really need boots back home.

170
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,469
要不咱们俩交换一下，我用…
We could do a trade. I've got...

171
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,347
不！这是我妈妈给我买的
No! My mother gave me those boots.

172
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,934
-那么，你能借给我穿穿吗？-不
- Maybe you could lend them to me?- No.

173
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,979
你比我们大家都先回家
You'll be home a lot sooner than us.

174
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,982
说得对，你不用等待回家了
That's right, you won't have to wait for leave now.

175
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,444
护士，护士，护士！
Orderly. Orderly!

176
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,114
她从没有来过
They don't come. They never come.

177
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,365
我们帮你去找她
We'll get someone.

178
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,577
-回到家里就一切都不一样了。-回到家里…
- It'll be different when you get home.- When you come back...

179
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,745
-我们还会见面的。-是的。我们明天还会来看你的
- We'll be together.- We'll come tomorrow.

180
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,666
-我们明天再见。-谢谢你们，谢谢你们
- (Paul) I'll come tomorrow.- Thank you. Thank you.

181
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,836
我会好的
(Franz) I'll be back.

182
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,213
一定要帮我找到我的手表
Make sure you get my watch.

183
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,882
好的
We will.

184
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,280
你真以为我不关心佛兰兹
You think I don't care about Franz.

185
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,324
当然关心
Of course I care.

186
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,996
如果我可以挽救他的腿和生命，我会不顾一切去做的。这你明白
If I could save his leg or life, I'd walk over barbed wire. You know that.

187
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,458
但是他要去的地方，不再需要靴子了
But where he's going,he isn't going to need his boots.

188
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,001
他什么都不再需要了
He isn't going to need anything.

189
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,795
但是我的脚很疼，真的很疼
And my boots hurt. They really hurt.

190
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,632
为什么让那些混蛋护士拿走他的靴子
Why should some damn orderly get his boots

191
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,717
而不是给他的朋友呢？
and not one of his friends?

192
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,804
他说得对，保罗
He's right, Paul.

193
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,356
我知道
I know.

194
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,241
非常好，堪布里奇
(Man) Very good, Kemmerich.

195
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,792
非常好，堪布里奇
Very good, Kemmerich.

196
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,838
他们截断了我的腿
They've amputated my leg.

197
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,678
只能这么做
Could be worse.

198
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,848
你知道吗，拉贝丢了右臂，他比你还倒霉
Wegler lost his right arm,which is very much worse.

199
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,019
也许你就要回家了
Besides, you're going home.

200
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,355
我想不会了
Do you think so?

201
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,731
当然会
Of course.

202
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,942
我想不会了
Do you think so?

203
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,197
你手术会痊愈的
Once you get over the operation.

204
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,827
恐怕不会了
I don't think so.

205
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,707
你不要胡思乱想
Don't talk nonsense.

206
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,879
我以前想当护林员
I wanted to be a forester once.

207
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,052
你会的
You will.

208
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:53,102
他们…现在做的假肢…
They... They make wonderful...artificial limbs...now.

209
00:21:55,022 --> 00:22:00,234
跟真的一样…放心，你做什么都可以
Attach them right to the muscle.You can do anything.

210
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:06,574
如果你找到了我的手表，就寄给我
If you find my watch, send it home.

211
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,413
你会住进康复中心的
You'll go to a convalescent home.

212
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,915
或许是哥拉斯堡的那个
Maybe the one in Klosterberg.

213
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,255
你还记得我们过去在那里玩儿吗？
Remember how we used to hike up there?

214
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,299
还有那些罂粟花？
Remember the poplars?

215
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,761
小溪里面全是鱼
The stream full of fish?

216
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:36,187
佛兰兹，佛兰兹…你恢复之后，我们还要一起爬山呢
Franz, Franz... When I come back,we go up to the mountains again.

217
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,483
你可以教我认识各种树
You can name all the trees for me.

218
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,860
告诉我它们的故事
Tell me all about them.

219
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,615
佛兰兹，一切都不会变的
Franz, nothing will change.

220
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,619
我们会回去的
We'd be together again.

221
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,999
佛兰兹
Franz? Franz.

222
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:04,965
把…我的靴子…交给…缪勒吧
Give...Müller...my...boots.

223
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,642
大夫！大夫！大夫在哪里？
Doctor? Doctor?Where's the doctor? Doctor!

224

229
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,828

从早上5点开始，手术接连不断

我们要把他抬走，没有床位了
We'll have to take him away at once.We need the bed.

234
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,681
还有人躺在地上呢
They're lying on the floor outside.

235
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,523
火车拉笛声
(Train whistle blows)

236
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,914
Don't forget, change your socks every day.

237
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,583
- Oh, Mother!

-他要干什么？他说什么了？他怎么说的？

The Russians are finished,the French are crumbling,

303
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,922
our U-boats are starving England.

304
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,508
The Americans will never fight.

305
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,677
Victory is in our hands.

306
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,346

No, no, Corporal.

402
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,537
是否应该把眼睛睁大点儿，下士
You must keep your eyes open, Corporal.

403
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,111
(Laughter and singing)

你们的训练告一段落
(Officer) Your training days are over.

412
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,621
现在你们是战士了，将编入皇家军队

413
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,709
要做好准备，为皇帝陛下和祖国而战
Fit and ready to do battle for the Kaiser and the Fatherland.

414
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,298
在前线，你们将会理解在这里学习的
In the front lines you will understand the value and the purpose

415
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:34,634
价值和目的
of everything you have learned here,

416
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,762
你们的教官训练你们的方法
everything your officers have taught you.

417
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,183
对你们来说有时不近人情
Their ways may have sometimes seemed harsh to you,

418
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,602
但是，你们会感谢他们
but you will thank your fine instructors

419
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,855
在这里教给你们的东西
for the lessons they taught you in this camp.

420
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,943
他们训练你们成为战士
They have taught you to be soldiers.

421
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,446
成为为上帝而战的斗士
To be soldiers in the service of Almighty God,

422
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,616
为了皇帝陛下，为了祖国
the Kaiser and the Fatherland.

423
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:04,122
向右——转！
(Corporal) Right...face.

426
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,224
(Train whistle blows)

427
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,917
(Officer) Open up.

428
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,529
全体，枪上肩
(Officer) Shoulder weapons.

429
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,746
向右——转
Right face.

430
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,500
上车
Board the train.

431
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,976
(Explosions)

432
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,236
禁止吸烟
(Officer) No smoking.

433
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,157
禁止吸烟！
No smoking.

434
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,046
5班下车，2班跟上
Fifth Company, get down.Hold up.

435
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,302
快，跟上。这边走，保持队形
Second Company.This way. Fall out, two ranks.

436
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,964
现在，你们来了
So... Here you are.

437
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,681
按这儿的习惯是给每个新兵排分配一个老兵
It's the custom to assign one old hand to every new platoon.

438
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,225
你们这个新兵排
You're the new platoon.

439
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,561
由我带队
I'm the old hand.

440
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,401
在新兵营地，那些人灌输了怎样成为新兵的奇谈怪论
In training camp they filled you with fancy information on how to be a soldier.

441
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,488
而这正是我们应该努力忘掉的东西
We're going to work hard to forget all that.

442
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,118
我要教给你们实用的，听我的，孩子
I'll teach you practic...Listen to me, boy.

443
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,996
我要教给你们实战技术
I'll teach you practical things.

444
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,291
比如说如何在前线换裤子
Like how to put your diapers on in the front lines.

445
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,835
如何杀死敌人
And how to kill Frenchies.

446
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,257
不用多久，我就会为你们洗礼的
You won't have long to wait before I baptise you.

447
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,760
我们首先得搞点儿热的东西吃，你们先睡一会儿
First we'll give you some hot food,let you get some sleep,

448
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,263
然后我带你们去巡逻
then I'll take you out on your first patrol...

449
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,057
今天晚上
..tonight.

450
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,144
(Artillery fire and explosions)

451
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:44,253
Those deep booms,that's the heavy artillery.

452
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,049
They're heading behind us, so don't worry.

453
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:53,095
They always come in threes,they always fall close together.

454
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:58,184

You've got five to ten seconds between each round to get where you wanna go.

455
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,103
You can hear them coming a long way off,that's the good thing.

456
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,022
Same with the mortar.

457
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,859
But the thing you gotta listen good for is the "Eeee!"

458
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,694
like a mosquito.

459
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,906
That's the small stuff they call daisy-cutters.

460
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,284
You've only got three seconds before they hit you.

461
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,870
Don't wait for anything!

462
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,291
Up here you've got to learn to trust your animal instinct.

463
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,001
You understand?

464
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:31,676
So... Don't wait. Move. When you're up this close and you hear something, anything,

465
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,719
hit the ground - fast.

466
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,222
- You understand?- (All) Yes, sir.

467
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,723
(Explosions continue)

468
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,272
听着孩子们，一会儿会有烟花的
All right, boys.There's gonna be some fireworks.

469
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,650
法国人会向你们问好的
Frenchie wants to say hello.

470
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,737
你们一定要紧跟着我
You just stick close to Kat,

471
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,991
我让你们动，你们才能动
and move when I tell you to move.

472
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,290
好了，赶快隐蔽，快，快隐蔽，快点儿
All right, take cover.Get off the road. Quick, quick!

473
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,252
(Explosions)

474
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,005
赶快隐蔽
(Kat) Get down. Off the road.

475
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,508
卧倒，趴下，趴下！
Take cover. Off the road!

476
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,310
(Soldiers scream)

477
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,398
(Whinnying and neighing)

478
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,457
快把伤马打死！
Shoot the wounded horses!

479
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,250
打死它们
Shoot them!

480
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,136
快开枪啊
Shoot them, can't you?

481
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,804
快开枪
Shoot them!

482
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,598
(Whinnying)

483
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,733
嗨！你疯了吗？你会伤着别人的
Hey! You crazy?You want to kill somebody?

484
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:11,776
卧倒
Get down.

485
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,987
(Whinnying)

486
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,872
(Screaming and gunfire)

487
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:43,182
为什么？它们做了什么？它们是无辜的
Why? What have they done?They haven't done anything.

488
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:51,357
不该用这些马，更不该杀了它们
Using horses is wrong.It's wrong killing horses.

489
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,154
好了孩子们，法国人不再纠缠了
(Kat) All right, boys.Frenchie's finished with you.

490
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,865
我们走，孩子们，快点儿
Come on, let's go, boys.

491
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,867
快起来
Get up.

492
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:11,043
起来，我们走，孩子
Up. Come on, boys.

493
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,885
大家都没事吧？
Everybody here?

494
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,514
嗯？大声回答
Huh? Link up, boys.

495
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,814
这只是让你们尝个鲜儿，将来你们会习惯的
(Kat) That's just a taste of the real thing.You'll get used to it.

496
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,150
排好队
You ready?

497
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,901
走吧
All right.

498
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,241
听着，你们现在基本上是士兵了
Well, you're almost getting to be soldiers now.

499
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,370
紧跟着我凯特就会安全的
You stick with Kat and you'll be all right.

500
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,509
(Distant explosions)

501
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,724
画外音：我们来前线已经1年了，我们都是士兵了
We have been at the front for a year.We are soldiers now.

502
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,809
对此地十分熟悉
We know this place well.

503
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,936
如同在家一样
We are at home.

504
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:15,733
只是堪布里奇死了。我们不断得到关于
Only Kemmerich is dead but we keep hearing about

505
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,152
同班同学的消息，阵亡或者受伤
others in our classdead, wounded.

506
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,991
我们每一个人都经常面临这样的情况
AIways, over every one of us,hangs the element of chance.

507
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,161
如果炮弹飞来，我们只有蹲下来
lf a shot comes,all we can do is duck,

508
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,914
因为我们无法预见炮弹落在哪里
because we can never know where it will fall.

509
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,583
(Explosions)

510
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,299
我可能在拆除炮弹引信时被炸成碎片
l can be smashed to bits in a bomb-proof dugout,

511
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,469
也可能在开阔地带存活10个小时而毫发无损
or l can survive ten hours unscathed out in the open.

512
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,856
当然每个士兵都相信机遇，相信运气
Of course, every soldier believes in chance and trusts his luck.

513
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,651
但没有谁可以永远这么走运
But no soldier outlives a thousand chances.

514
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,697

Flamethrowers. A new invention.

515
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,159
To the list of ways by which the keenest minds in the world

516
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,578
are making it easy to kill one another,

517
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,957
add this miracle of modern industriaI ingenuity.

518
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,333
lncineration.

519
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,507
这里的老鼠尤其令人厌恶，它们吃得那么肥
The rats here are particularly repulsive.They are so fat.

520
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,634
我们叫它食人鼠
We call them corpse rats.

521
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,596
它们长着一副可怕的面孔。即使在空腹的时候
They have shocking evil faces and even on our empty stomachs,

522
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,766
看到它们长而无毛的尾巴，仍然让人作呕
it is nauseating to see their long naked tails.

523
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:41,902
诱饵是一块发了霉的甚至我们都不吃的面包
The bait is bread, which is so rotten that even we won't eat it.

524
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,699
这些老鼠十分胆大，只要有一小堆面包渣
These rats are so brazen.lf we make a pile of rotten crusts,

525
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,785
它们就会钻出来，想把面包渣拖走
they'll come right among us to snatch them away.

526
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,538
(Excited shouting)

527
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,292
这是一种消磨时间的方法
lt's a way to pass the time.

528
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,058
防毒面具，戴防毒面具
Gas gas! Gas gas!

529
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:59,021
毒气是最令人生畏的最可憎的武器
Gas, the most feared,the most obscene weapon of all.

530
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,483
我们忘不了医院中的可怕场面
We remember the awful sights in the hospitaI.

531
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,110
一群中毒气的人，他们剧烈地咳嗽
The gas patients who, suffocating,

532
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,821
把灼伤的肺，一块一块地吐了出来
cough up their burnt lungs in clots.

533
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,657
最好尽量待在开阔的地方
Better to take your chances in the open

534
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,953
不要停留在空而低的地方，那里往往聚集着毒气
rather than stay in the hollows where the vapours settle.

535
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,123
(Whistling shells and explosions)

536
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,981
新兵的价值远不及他们带来的麻烦多
The new recruits give us more trouble than they are worth.

537
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,609
每死5到10个新兵才死1个老兵
Between five and ten of them get kiIIed to every oId hand.

538
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,155
他们的死仅仅是因为缺乏经验
And they get kiIIed simpIy because they are so inexperienced.

539
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:35,033
他们一无所知，像苍蝇一样的死去
They know nothing,so they die like flies.

540
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,120
不，不！
(All) No, don't! No!

541
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,872
(Paul) Get him.

542
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,167
(Heavy coughing)

543
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,565
把枪给我，把枪给我
Hand me a rifle. Hand me a rifle.

544
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,490
等等，凯特
Kat, wait!

545
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,760
他是孩子
A baby.

546
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,223
他还是个孩子
Just a baby.

547
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:20,055
Mind the wire.

548
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,445
我们前来报到
They're in position.

549
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,656
很好
- Nearby?- Yes, sir.

550
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,366
画外音：我们打了多久了？
How long has it been?

551
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:43,161
几个星期？几个月？几年？
Weeks, months, years?

552
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,746
其实只是几天
Only days.

553
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,208
昨天我们受到攻击，今天可以休息了
Yesterday we were under fire.Today we can rest.

554
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,628
明天则又要走进战壕
Tomorrow we go up to the trenches again.

555
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,067
(Honking)

556
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,323
孩子们，过来孩子们
Boys, boys, come here.

557
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,075
听着，你们从那边儿抄过去
Look, you fellas go on that side.

558
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,036
咱们走这边儿，快
Over here. This way.

559
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,829
轻点儿
(Kat) Easy, easy.

560
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,668
拦住它，那边儿
Get around, get around up there.

561
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,218
-别让它跑了！-抓住它
- Come on!- Get it!

562
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,347
把它抓住
Get him!

563
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,400
(Laughter)

564
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,077
有人吃肝吗？我可要节食了
Somebody eat the liver. I'm on a diet.

565
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:12,793
我老婆会加上很多的月桂叶和辣椒粉
My old woman would have used lots of bay leaves, basil, paprika,

566
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,756
再加上一些特别的佐料
and the stuffing would have been something very special.

567
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,550
应有尽有
But all things considered...

568
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,136
丰盛的晚宴，我像个皇帝
(Paul) It was a feast. I feel like a king.

569
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,514
噢，不赖，不赖
(Kat) Ah, not bad, not bad.

570
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,434
我说过，战争也不赖
Like I say, it's not a bad little war.

571
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,855
你从不回答我的问题，约瑟夫
You never answered my question, Josef.

572
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,607
什么问题
What question?

573
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,026
战争结束后你打算做什么？
What'll you do after all this is over?

574
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,779
我们打算酩酊大醉
What we'll all do. Get drunk.

575
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,240
That's the most intelligent answer I've heard yet.

576
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,742
当然要喝醉
Of course he'll get drunk.

577
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,037
然后是回家找妈妈，除了这些…
Then it's back home and mama and all that.

578
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,372
还有呢？
But what else?

579
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,291
跟他说吧，别不好意思
(Paul) Tell him, Josef.Don't be ashamed.

580
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,459
我不是害羞
I'm not ashamed.

581
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:58,088
他打算去神学院，将来当个牧师
He's going to theology school to be a minister.

582
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,177
在前线待了一年，你还没有改变你的想法？
A year at the front and you haven't changed your mind about that?

583
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,638
上帝还在天堂里吗？
Is God still in his heaven?

584
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,432
这永远不会改变
Nothing ever changes that.

585
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,686
-那么你呢缪勒？
- And you, Müller?- I'm going to be an engineer.

586
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:16,231
That's all I've ever wanted to be.I'm one of the lucky ones.

587
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,985
- Why?- I've always known what I wanted to do.

588
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,112
Like Behm.

589
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,656
Like the farmer boy. Eh?

590
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,451
Straight back to the harvest, Detering?

591
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,079
Back to my horses and my sheep and the harvest.

592
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,914
And my wife.

593
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:37,252
What will you do, Tjaden?

594
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,422
Make sure Himmelstoss doesn't get past me.

595
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,799
I know what I want.

596
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,551
We all know what you want.

597
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,512
I want to undress every mademoiselle from here to the Rhine.

598
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,973
We're talking about future careers, Leer.

599
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:52,893
I fully intend to make a career of my lifelong hobby.

600
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:56,062
I'm gonna become the world's first professor of lust.

601
01:02:57,398 --> 01:03:01,818
那么你呢？想回去重操旧业吗?啊？
What about you?Back to the cobbler's bench, yeah?

602
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:02,861
还有孩子
And the children.

603
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,237
有几个孩子？
(Paul) How many you got?

604
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,449
这你别问，鞋匠是个好工作
Don't ask.Good thing I'm a shoemaker,

605
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,410
人不能总买新鞋穿
or I'd go broke just buying shoes.

606
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,039
What about you, Westus?

607
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,167
A feather bed.

608
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,544
Yeah. And a fat girl.

609
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,379
I won't get up for a week!

610
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,467
The question is, what will you do for a living?

611
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,511
Mm?

612
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,891
You know what? I think I'll stay in the army.

613
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,645
- Are you crazy?- Well, in peace time the food's good,

614
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,607
you sleep in a bed and every week you get clean underwear.

615
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,277
In the evenings, you're a free man,you go off to the beer hall.

616
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,490
It's a much better life than digging peat.

617
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,325
Much better.

618
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,418
-来新棺材了。-好像比平时数量多
(Kat) More coffins.(Paul) A bigger load than usual.

619
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,587
要有一场更大的战斗了
That means a bigger offensive.

620
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,136
你看总部的人们想得多周到啊
How considerate they are at headquarters.

621
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,264
他们连装尸体的棺材都运来了
They even send us the stuff to fill them with.

622
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,766
(Officer) Come on, get this one down.

623
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,935
(Officer) Haul them up.

624
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,580
(Officer) Careful, careful.

625
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,126
(Soldiers talking)

626
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,420
你有多大？
How old are you?

627
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:46,047
16岁
Sixteen.

628
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,676
明年他才刚刚成年
Next year, right out of the cradle.

629
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:02,188
-这是你刻得血槽？-是的先生
- Did you notch this bayonet?- Yes, sir.

630
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,025
谁教给你的？
Who told you to?

631
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:08,528
-在新兵营学的…-新兵营？
- At the training camp...- Training camp, eh?

632
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:13,658
小兄弟，如果敌人用它刺着你，他们不会杀你
Sonny, if the enemy ever caught you with this, they wouldn't kill you,

633
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:17,329
而是挑出你的眼球，然后在填一些木渣
they'd plump your eyes out and fill them full of sawdust.

634
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,831
现在没人再用刺刀了
Nobody uses these things any more.

635
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,001
交战双方已经达成了协议
It's by mutual agreement,on both sides.

636
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,586
我不知道
(Recruit) I didn't know.

637
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,922
-第一次来前线？-是的先生
- First time at the front?- Yes, sir.

638
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,591
别叫我“先生”，我不是长官
Don't "sir" me. I'm a private.

639
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,217
对不起，我想
Sorry, I thought...

640
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,386
不要想，“听”就够了
Don't think. Just listen.

641
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,680
是！先生
Yes, sir.

642
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,184
你的铁铲好得多
Your spade is better.

643
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,812
用铁铲击打敌人的脖子，他的脑袋就飞了
You hit a man under the chin,you can take his head off.

644
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,357
它还是一根不错的棒子
It's a good club, too.

645
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:47,484
它很有分量
Cos it's heavy.

646
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:52,697
要击打脖子和肩膀中间的部分，就在这儿，你能把他劈成两半儿
Hit a man between neck and shoulder.Right here. Split him right in two.

647
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:54,699
-我的天哪！-这样会干净些
- Mother of God!- It's cleaner.

648
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:58,995
刺刀会卡在敌人的肋骨里，你还要踢他一脚才能够拔得出来
Bayonet gets stuck in ribs,you have to kick him to pull it out.

649
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,124
当你拔出来，你也死了，哼！
Time it takes, you're a dead man.

650
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,169
明白吗？
Understand?

651
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:12,550
我说你们的排长呢？嗯?
Now, where is your platoon leader?

652
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,594
西摩尔斯托斯下士说来接我们
Corporal Himmelstoss said he would meet us here.

653
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,846
哦
Ah.

654
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,223
什么下士？
Corporal who?

655
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,183
西摩尔斯托斯
Himmelstoss.

656
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,310
-从奥德堡军营来的？-是的先生
- From Oldenberg training station?- Yes, sir.

657
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,854
真不敢相信
(Friedrich) I don't believe it!

658
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:28,024
我要报仇啦！
Vengeance is mine!

659
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:32,320
那头小猪怎么跑到这儿来啦？总不会是自愿上前线的吧？
How did he mess up his playground?He didn't volunteer for the front?

660
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,656
不，先生，他出了点儿麻烦
No, sir. He got into trouble.

661
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:39,285
他在泥地上对几个新兵做过火了，你知道泥地吧？
Overdid it with a couple of trainees on the muddy field. You know the muddy field?

662
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,664
我知道泥地吗？嗯哼？
Do we know the muddy field?

663
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,750
他太过分了，他差点儿杀了他们
He went too far. He almost killed them.

664
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,795
宪兵发现地方长官的孩子在一旁观看
And he didn't know the son of the local magistrate was watching.

665
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,923
所以他们才会送他来，你会知道他会自作自受的
So they sent him up here. Wouldn't you know he'd spoil it for himself?

666
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,093
他迟早会做过火的
Wouldn't you know he'd go just too far?

667
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,930
嗷，天哪！我等不及啦
Oh, Lord. I can hardly wait.

668
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,101
啊哦，看呐，是谁来啦？
Oh, well. Look who's here.

669
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,276
让一下
Out of the way!

670
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,367
好啊，又见面了
Well, we meet again.

671
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:26,541
克洛普是吗？你还记得我吗？西摩尔斯托斯下士
Kropp, isn't it? You remember me,Corporal Himmelstoss.

672
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,545
缪勒，你也在这儿？哦，你给我的印象很深呐
Müller, you here too?Oh, yes, I remember you very well.

673
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:37,260
啊，里尔，贝母，鲍曼
Leer, Behm, Baumer...Baumer.

674
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,639
你们看我的脑子没出问题吧？
Nothing wrong with my memory!

675
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:47,896
我以前说过，我教的东西你们将永世不忘
Well, I told you that what I taught you,you'd never forget.

676
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,315
看来你们都成功地活下来了
I see you've all managed to stay alive.

677
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,984
除了堪布里希
Not Kemmerich.

678
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,321
堪布里希？不，我不记得这个人
Kemmerich?I don't remember Kemmerich.

679
01:07:57,364 --> 01:08:00,492
你们其他人看来确实学得不错
The rest of you seem to have learned your lessons pretty well.

680
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:04,370
你要准备学一课了，我上了前线以后
Here's your lesson, Himmelstoss.When you get to the front,

681
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,414
你千万别回头看
don't you turn your back.

682
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,001
你说什么？
What did you say?

683
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,838
你就是大名鼎鼎的西摩尔斯托斯下士？
So this is the great Corporal Himmelstoss?

684
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,342
你是谁？
And who are you?

685
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,177
回答我的问题！小兵
I asked you a question, soldier.

686
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:26,351
西摩尔斯托斯，路边上有一个厕所
Himmelstoss.There's a latrine down the road.

687
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,688
你还不赶紧去？
Why don't you take a jump?

688
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,774
别忘了我是你们的长官
Do you realise that I'm your superior officer?

689
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,943
你想上军事法庭吗？
Do you want to be court martialled?

690
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,531
注意身体站直了，两腿并拢
Stand up straight, heels together,

691
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,033
长官在对你们说话
when your superior officer speaks to you.

692
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:49,374
听见没有？
All of you!

693
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,585
立正
Squad, attention!

694
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,757
向右看——齐
Right...face.

695
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:02,637
向右——转，全体注意，齐步——走
Right turn, forward...march.

696
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,724
左……
Left, left, left, left.

697
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:10,687
左……
(All chant) Left, left,left, left, left, left.

698
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:33,126

They are being good to us.They brought us delicious edamer cheese.

699
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:37,422
We eat and drink of course but there is no joy in it

700
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:41,259
because they always feed us like this before they send us into hell.

701
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,137
Kat has lost his fun.

702
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,473
When he smells cheese he also smells trouble

703
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,601
and of course it comes.

704
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:58,109
别紧张，孩子，别紧张
(Kat) Easy, boy, easy.It'll be all right.

705
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:25,303
你知道，他怎么被炸飞的吗？嘭！就这样
Ah, you see the way he blows up?Boom, like that.

706
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,764
(Explosion)

707
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,141
我要杀了法国佬
(Kat) Want to kill Frenchmen?

708
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:34,312
当你干完之后，我要用他的黄油擦我的靴子
Hey, give me the tin when you finish.I can use the fat to polish my boots.

709
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,110
(Manic humming)

710
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,921
一会儿就好了，孩子
You'll be all right, boy.

711
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,839
你会习惯的
You'll get used to it.

712
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,551
发起进攻之前他们总是要炮火轰炸
They always shell us like this before a big offensive.

713
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,513
目的是削弱我们的力量，不让我们休息
To soften us up so we can't sleep.

714
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,598
哦，等他们发起进攻的时候
Huh, then when they attack,

715
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:14,102
我们便无法抵抗，因为太疲惫了
we won't be able to fight back because we're too tired.

716
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:19,357
已经两天两夜了，还有多久？
Two days and nights. How much longer?

717
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,193
没多久了，没多久了
Not too long, not too long.

718
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,487
他们怎么不睡觉啊？
Why don't they stop?

719
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,698
(Shells whistling and explosions)

720
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,924
你要到哪儿去？
Where are you going?

721
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,884
我马上…马上回来
I'll be back...in a minute.

722
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:51,389
好了，别紧张，再等等，马上就结束了，坐下
No, just relax. Wait. It'll be over soon.Come on, sit down and relax.

723
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,517
(Shouts warning)

724
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:58,062
等等！干什么？坐下！
(Young recruit)Let me go. I must get away. I must go!

725
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,191
(Shouting)

726
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,905
嗨！干什么？坐下坐下
Sit down and calm down.

727
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:11,743
都坐下，马上就没事儿了，别紧张，都冷静点儿
(Kat) Now, go and sit down.Behave yourselves. Be easy, quiet.

728
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:14,412
控制情绪
Listen...

729
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,455
(Whistle)

730
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,873
Attack!

731
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,916
(Shouting)

732
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:27,008
全部出击，快快快！快点儿！
(Kat) Come on, let's go.Come on... Come on!

733
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,262
(Manic humming and sobbing)

734
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:45,193
画外音：我们不能再这样下去坐以待毙
No longer do we lie helpless,awaiting destruction.

735
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:50,114
我们只能通过毁灭和杀戮来拯救自己报仇雪耻
We can destroy and kiII to save ourselves and to be revenged.

736
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:56,287
每当我们看到他们的面孔，我们就成了野兽
When we see their faces,we become wild beasts.

737
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,664
成了恶魔和凶手
We turn into thugs and murderers.

738
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,125
只有上帝知道是谁在作祟
lnto God only knows what devils.

739
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,503
即使是你的父亲和法国人一道过来
lf your own father was with them,

740
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,547
你也会毫不犹豫地把炸弹向他投去
you wouldn't hesitate to fling a bomb into him.

741
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,222
冲！冲啊！
- (Whistle)- (Kat) Forward!

742
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,516
(Shouting)

743
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,446
你们在干什么？
What the hell is this?

744
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,115
快跟我一起冲，快上！上！
Come on, let's go. Come on, you all.

745
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,409
快上！还有你
Come on. You too, soldier.

746
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,077
(Mumbles)

747
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:21,581
快上！你这个胆小鬼，上啊，上啊！
Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go!Damn it, let's go!

748
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:23,332
你们两个在干什么？
What's happening down there?

749
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,377
快！
Come on!

750
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,504
(Machin-gun fire)

751
01:14:28,672 --> 01:14:31,591
冲啊！
Charge! Come on!

752
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:38,306
这样持续了多久？多少天，多少星期，多少个月，多少年？
How Iong is it? Days,and weeks, and months, and years.

753
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,059
进攻，然后反攻，尸体堆成了小山
Attack, counter-attack.And the dead piIe up.

754
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:47,732
冬去夏来…白天炎热难当，尸体暴露在外面
Winter, summer... The days are hot and the dead lie unburied.

755
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,650
炮弹会埋葬他们的
The shells will bury them.

756
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,237
迎面而来的风带来了血腥的气味
But when the wind blows,it brings the smell of blood,

757
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,656
浓重而略带甜味
which is heavy and sweet.

758
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,011
什么人？
(French soldier shouts)

759
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,142
(Artillery rumbling)

760
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,146
炮弹啸叫声
(Shell whistles)

761
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:39,510
哨声
(Whistle)

762
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,202
机枪射击声
(Gasps for breath)

763
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,464
机枪连射声
(Rapid gunfire)

764
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:20,051
(Moaning)

765
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:21,630
(Groans)

766
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,852
(Shell whistles)

767
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:42,026
(Moaning)

768
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,418
(Agonised cries)

769
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,629
不，嘘…
No, shh...shh...

770
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,716
嘘…
Shh! Shh!

771
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:49,593
不，不
No, no...

772
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:55,099
不，嘘…别害怕，我是来救你的…
- (Cries out)- No, shh. Aider. Je vous...

773
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,936
我想要救你，我要帮助你，抬起头，别害怕
Je vous...help...I want to help you.

774
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,159
Ohh!

775
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,661
(Drawn-out gasp)

776
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,012
我不想杀害你
I didn't want to kill you.

777
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:21,185
是你跳进这里来，于世无求
But you jumped in here like that.

778
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:27,107
换了你会怎么做？我想…
What would you have done? It's...

779
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:32,529
我想我们早就应该这样…像这样…
It's just I'd never met you before...like this...

780
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:36,200
面对面的
face to face.

781
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,747
我看到了你的步枪
I just saw your rifle...

782
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,918
你的刺刀
your bayonet...

783
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:49,713
手榴弹
grenades.

784
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,928
如果把这些全扔掉，也许…
If we threw all those away...

785
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,891
我们可以成为兄弟
we could be brothers.

786
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:07,815
但是有些人不想让我们这样，对吧？
But they never want us to know that, do they?

787
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:13,070
他们不想让我们知道
They never want us to know.

788
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,950
我们都有母亲
We each have mothers...

789
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,370
有父亲
fathers...

790
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,749
都一样
the same...

791
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,169
总攻及死亡
fear of death.

792
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,465
一样
The same...

793
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,719
痛苦
pain.

794
01:23:38,221 --> 01:23:40,097
都一样
The same...

795
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,309
原谅我
everything.

796
01:23:47,772 --> 01:23:49,773
请你…
Everything.

797
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,035
原谅我，我的好兄弟
Forgive me, comrade.

798
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,886
我会给你的家，写信的
I could write...to your family.

799
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:23,515
是的
Yes...

800
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:25,350
是的，我会写的
Yes, I'll write!

801
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,752
杰连德·杜尔，印刷工
"Gerard Duval, compositeur."

802
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:56,173
我杀死了杰连德·杜尔，一个印刷工
l have killed Gerard Duval the printer.

803
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:01,738
注意，全体立正
(Commander) Battalion, attention!

804
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,744
持枪致敬
Present arms!

805
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:15,627
行注目礼
Eyes left!

806
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:19,298
万岁！万岁！万岁！
(All shout)

807
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,950
我是军团指挥官，皇帝陛下
Battalion Commander, sir.

808
01:27:28,117 --> 01:27:31,453
现在允许我，荣幸地请您检阅
Your Majesty, I have the honour to bring you the salute

809
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:34,331
第150军团
of the 150th Infantry Battalion.

810
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:54,476
皇帝陛下，士兵贝纳德
Your Majesty, Soldier Bernard.

811
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:12,369
皇帝陛下，士兵兰格
Your Majesty, Soldier Langer.

812
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,850
皇帝陛下，下士西摩尔斯托斯
Your Majesty, Corporal Himmelstoss.

813
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,033
全体稍息
Battalion! At ease!

814
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:57,748
军官们，全体军士们，全体士兵们
Officers, non-commissioned officers,enlisted men.

815
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:01,710
今天，荣获奖章的人们都为我们
The men who have received decorations this day

816
01:29:01,878 --> 01:29:05,922
伟大的事业做出了巨大的贡献
have all performed actions worthy of our great cause.

817
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:10,469
今后，希望你们每一个人都能以他们为榜样
Henceforth, Germany expects each of you to follow their example.

818
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:17,059
你们的皇帝号召你们，从今天开始，充满力量
From this day on, your Kaiser urges you all to aspire to such strength,

819
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:23,857
勇敢顽强，忠于职守，热爱上帝和祖国
to such bravery, to such obedience to your God and your country.

820
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,943
如果，你们真能做到这一点
If you do, my soldiers,

821
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:31,448
我相信，你们每一个人都会佩戴上
I am certain that every one of you will one day wear a medal

822
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,076
由皇帝为你们亲自颁发的勋章
pinned on you by your Kaiser.

823
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,913
你们都继承了德意志战士为国尽忠的优良传统
You have all done your duty in the noble tradition of the German warrior.

824
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:41,875
你们向世界展示了力量
You have shown the world our might.

825
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:45,837
你们击溃了我们的敌人，他们害怕了
You have stricken our enemies with fear.

826
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:51,802
上帝保佑我们，你们必将为祖国赢得光辉的胜利
With God's help, you are winning a glorious victory for the Fatherland.

827
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,266
The Kaiser! Just wait till I tell my father.

828
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:00,811
Oh, yeah? What'll you tell him?

829
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:03,105
I'll tell him I saw the Kaiser!

830
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,232
Up this close - he's never gonna believe it.

831
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,485
- He seemed like a very nice man.- Yeah, really nice.

832
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:11,154
Do you think it's true they forced him into this war?

833
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:13,615
- I wouldn't say that.- Why not?

834
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:16,284
It's the generals' fault, he had to say yes.

835
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:19,871
- So the generals started the war?- The French generals, yes.

836
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:22,999
The French generals told the Kaiser we had to have a war?

837
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,001
No, you don't understand...

838
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:27,379
Be careful with these uniforms, boys.

839
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:29,798
They have to be handed down to the next bunch of heroes

840
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,591
that gets reviewed by the Kaiser.

841
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:34,428
Kat, why do you think we're in this war?

842
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,515
- Protect the Fatherland.- What are the French fighting for?

843
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,350
Protect the Motherland.

844
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,018
And who's right?

845
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,229
Whoever wins.

846
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,731
That's not very patriotic.

847
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:50,193
- Not very what?- Patriotic.

848
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:56,199
Maybe not. Maybe it's not very patriotic to use your head.

849
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:59,536
Maybe the real patriot just goes out and gets his head blown off.

850
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,414
- And gets a medal for it.- Like Himmelstoss?

851
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,708
Can you imagine that little peacock getting a medal?

852
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,251
From the Kaiser?

853
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,295
Be fair, he deserved it.

854
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:12,215
He behaved like a true German soldier.

855
01:31:12,383 --> 01:31:15,093
He ran ahead when he was told to run ahead

856
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,512
and he ran back when he was told to run back.

857
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:22,642
The only thing he didn't do like a German soldier...was die.

858
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,356
Do you think that's what we're fighting for?Just to die?

859
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:32,819
Well, do you know what we're fighting for?

860
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:36,031
Does anybody know what we're fighting for?

861
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:38,241
Does the Kaiser?

862
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:41,912
Maybe if he'd stayed out of it in the first place there'd be no war.

863
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:43,914
Corporal.

864
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,459
Come in.

865
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:00,138
Sit down.

866
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:10,524
Listen, their country insulted ours that's how it started.

867
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:14,861
"Their country insulted ours"?I don't understand.

868
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,156
A mountain in France insulted a mountain Germany?

869
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:20,408
Ah, you know what I mean.

870
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:26,540
- One country offended the other.- Then what am I doing here?

871
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:27,832
I haven't been offended.

872
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,795
How could I be offended?I've never even been to France before.

873
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,090
In all my life I've only known a handful of Frenchies.

874
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:38,468
They seemed all right to me.Human, people.

875
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,805
Let me tell you, the only reason we're fighting this war

876
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:44,099
is because it's useful to somebody.

877
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:46,476
Hm? But who?

878
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:48,103
Not for me.

879
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:51,147
Let me tell you something else about those generals.

880
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:53,358
They're getting something out of all this too.

881
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:54,693
What do they get?

882
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,653
Famous!

883
01:32:57,196 --> 01:32:59,948
Hey, anybody ever heard of Vitry-les-Bois?

884
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:01,324
It's a French pastry!

885
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:04,494
It's an occupied French village and we're all going there.

886
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:07,497
- What for?- For seven days' leave!

887
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:10,083
(All cheer)

888
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:21,469
(Albert) Ever seen anything as beautiful as that.

889
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:24,139
Never.

890
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,349
How old would you say she is?

891
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:27,767
21 , 22.

892
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:31,271
Oh, no. I don't think she'd be older than us.

893
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:34,608
I'd say...1 7 at the most.

894
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:37,277
Oh, she's so clean.

895
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,280
Why not? I bet she take a bath every single day.

896
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,199
Mm, twice. Three times a day.

897
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:45,327
There's no dirt under those fingernails.

898
01:33:47,204 --> 01:33:50,373
How far do you suppose he could march with shoes like that?

899
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,461
- Do you remember white trousers?- Do I!

900
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:57,297
I have a pair like that at home.

901
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:28,453
(Sighs) It would be nice, wouldn't it, Albert?

902
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:34,250
Maybe we could go over to the de-lousing station.

903
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:36,586
Why? You'll be covered again in half an hour.

904
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,046
I just feel so dirty.

905
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,757
Hey! Get your hands off her, she's mine!

906
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,426
Oh my!

907
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:49,057
What are these filthy-minded Krauts been saying, sweetheart?

908
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:52,644
Come on, shutzy, throw a little my way.

909
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:56,147
You know, she looks a lot like the first one I ever had.

910
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:57,857
Olga.

911
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:00,944
Olga, my little peasant calf.

912
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,446
Come on, you never had anything like that.

913
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:05,824
Oh no?

914
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,494
See you later.

915
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,538
- Where are you going?- Sightseeing.

916
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,581
What's wrong with this sight?

917
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,420
(Inhales sharply)

918
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:20,296
(Both laughing)

919
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,801
我需要用6个星期才能把皮肤洗出来
It'll take six weeks to get to the skin!

920
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:28,221
-我能用用你那块香皂吗？-当然可以。-水怎么样？
- Can I have a piece of that soap?- How's the water?

921
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,932
好极了！赶紧下来吧，伙计
Beautiful! Come on in!

922
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,684
唉！快看呐
Hey! Look at that!

923
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,981
(All shout in mock French)

924
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:43,319
嗨！姑娘们，你们好
- Hello! Bonjour, bonjour!- Jolies! Jolies!

925
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:46,656
跟她们说点什么，叫她们过来
Somebody do something!Just don't let them get away!

926
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:51,161
哎，姑娘们过来
Allo, Mademoiselles!Allo, Mademoiselles!

927
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:54,372
姑娘们，过来吧
Ami! Ami, mademoiselles!

928
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:57,333
过来吧，姑娘们
Une minute, madame!

929
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:00,628
告诉她们别走啊
- Attendez, s'il vous plait!- Tell them to come over.

930
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:05,884
嗨，别走啊姑娘们，过来聊一聊好吗
Er, yes, er... Mademoiselle,You come over this side, oui?

931
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,428
我给你们爱情
Vous venez, s'il vous plaît.

932
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:12,724
-问她们今天晚上能做些什么？-姑娘们别走啊
- Ask them what they're doing tonight.- Don't let them get away!

933
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:16,853
姑娘们，别走好吗
Er, nous vivons à vous parler,all right?

934
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,106
(Girls giggling)

935
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:23,193
（以下一通乱喊，直到她们看到面包）
- Tell 'em we want to talk.- Talk?!

936
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,196
- Parlez vous, Mesdemoiselles!- Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

937
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:28,907
Tell them... Mademoiselles!

938
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,368
Venez assi!

939
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:34,370
No, that's not it, it's venez ici.

940
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:37,123
Frauleins, l'amour, yes?

941
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:40,084
You coming over,we have l'amour, yes?

942
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:42,712

01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,840
-不要走嘛！-呦吼吼！

哞……，怎么样？面包

947
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:59,145
面包，啊，要吗？

948
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,356
你们…

949
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,024
今天晚上…

950
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,234
到这儿来！

951
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:07,070
Maintenant!

952
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,196
Oui! Oui!

953
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,406
-她们说些什么？-
- What did she say?- They want us to come over. No...

954
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:12,826
- Pas possible!- No, we can't!

955
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,621
We can't! There's guards, sentries,you understand? Watch.

956
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,290
We can't, they're up there.

957
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,419
(Whispering)

958
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:25,588
你们
Ce soir!

959
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,757
你们晚上
Vous venez!

960
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:30,343
到那边儿
Lá-bas!

961
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,803
我们的家里去
Nôtre maison!

962
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:35,598
他们要我们今天晚上去找她们去
They want us to come to their house tonight!

963
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:39,018
对，顺便带些吃的东西，懂吗？
Oui! Avec quelque chose à manger, oui?

964
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:42,730
要让我们带吃的过去！我们就住那边儿！
- (Paul) With something to eat!- La maison là!

965
01:37:42,898 --> 01:37:44,607
去我们家
Maison!

966
01:37:44,775 --> 01:37:48,403
姑娘们，再见！
- Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!- Bye! Bye!

967
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:53,283
(Excited cheering)

968
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:00,999
全喝了，夏登
Drink up, Tjaden.

969
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:12,135
真够不走运的，她们是3个人，可是我们是4个
It's bad luck there's four of us and three of them.

970
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,762
哦，不走运
(Slurs) Mm-hmm... Bad luck.

971
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,474
我说我觉得这对姑娘不公平
See, I just don't think it's fair to the girls.

972
01:38:19,518 --> 01:38:22,645
快喝干了吧夏登，难得有法国的好酒喝
Drink up, Tjaden. How often do you get good French wine?

973
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:27,442
为姑娘们…干杯
Not fair to the girls... No.

974
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,821
我们当中需要有人做出…巨大的牺牲
One of us will have to make the supreme sacrifice.

975
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,781
(⊙o⊙)嗯
Mmm?

976
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:37,160
干了吧夏登，你不用跟我们一起去了
Bottoms up, Tjaden,you're not keeping up with us.

977
01:38:39,204 --> 01:38:41,164
(Mumbles)

978
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,708
要不我们抓阄吧？
Maybe we should draw lots?

979
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:48,838
你输了
You lose.

980
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:51,549
(Snoring)

981
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:46,842
来了，他们来了…快点儿披上，别着凉了，快上来，快上来…
(Chatter and laughter)

982
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,694
-晚上好。-晚上好
- Bonsoir.- (Girls) Bonsoir.

983
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:07,792
(Girls chuckle)

984
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:20,757
喔，有奶油，有面包，真是太好了，给你奶酪，你的
(Shout excitedly in French)

985
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:30,643
都坐下，大家都坐下，你自己先吃吗？给我，给我
(Chatter happily in French)

986
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,448
-很久没有吃到这么好吃的东西了。
-他们的面包也很好吃，要不要尝一块儿？
(Speaking French)

987
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:44,870
男：我觉得右边这个不错。女：这个很好吃，尝尝这个
This looks like the right line-up, huh?

988
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:47,040
男：我就要她了。女：（食物的味道）真不错
I'm all for this one.

989
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:49,625
你想做什么
You like yours, Albert?

990
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:51,002
哦，是的是的
Yes.

991
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:58,171
男：保罗？女：别急。瞧他们冻得！待会儿，肯定跟咱们上床了。
Paul?

992
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:36,547
你的脸色这么苍白？
Mais tu es blanc comme neige, toi.

993
01:41:36,715 --> 01:41:38,341
哦…我…
Er...

994
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:42,678
我说的不对吗小家伙？
Est-ce que je me trompe,petit bon homme?

995
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:48,514
男：哦，是的是的。女：瞧他笑得多可爱
Oui!

996
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:15,837
(Clock chimes)

997
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,320
我的小战士
Mon petit soldat.

998
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,616
过来，过来
Viens. Viens.

999
01:42:51,957 --> 01:42:53,332
来，坐这儿来
Non, non. Ici.

1000
01:43:06,096 --> 01:43:08,222
-你有多大了？-啊？
- Quelle âge as tu?- Eh?

1001
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,266
-你多大了？
- Ton âge?- No...

1002
01:43:10,434 --> 01:43:13,686
-你的年龄？-哦，19
- Quelle âge as tu?- Ah! I'm nineteen.

1003
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,315
19
Nineteen.

1004
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:19,483
19
Nineteen... Oh!

1005
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:31,454
25？我不信，你看上去没那么大
Vingt-cinq ans? Vraiment?Tu exaggeres, non?

1006
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:11,661
The room grows dim and dissolves in the half-light

1007
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:15,539
and only the face near mine lives and is clear.

1008
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:19,710
The face is touched with a tenderness that comes out of the night...

1009
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:23,256
and l let it all fall from me.

1010
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:26,175
War and terror,

1011
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:28,177
and grossness,

1012
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:32,014
in order to awaken young and happy.

1013
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:57,707
快隐蔽，快隐蔽
(Man) Look out! Look out! Take cover!

1014
01:45:01,378 --> 01:45:03,504
(Shouting and screaming)

1015
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:30,740
(Panicked shouting)

1016
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:07,109
快！快
Come on! Come on, Albert!

1017
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:19,705
-我的腿！-快起来，快起来
- My leg!- Come on, Albert! Up! Up!

1018
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:28,422
快！拉住我，快离开这儿
Come on, boys, a little bit more.

1019
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:37,848
(Screams of agony)

1020
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:47,942
趴下，趴下！
Down! Stay down!

1021
01:46:50,612 --> 01:46:52,321
(Shell whistles)

1022
01:47:02,624 --> 01:47:04,667
(Groaning)

1023
01:47:06,169 --> 01:47:07,878
(Shell whistles)

1024
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,533
我马上就回来
I'll be right back!

1025
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:14,778
担架！
Hey!

1026
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:24,705
(Screaming)

1027
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:26,290
快，快！
Easy!

1028
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:38,719
保罗
Paul!

1029
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:40,513
你多保重
Take care!

1030
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:54,902
你的枪，凯特
Kat.

1031
01:49:01,117 --> 01:49:02,493
凯特
Kat!

1032
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:04,662
这边儿，走这边儿
Kat, come on!

1033
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:14,797
-你会好的。-轻点儿
- All right.- Easy, easy.

1034
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:30,479
-这是凯特给你的。-什么？
- It's from Kat.- What is it?

1035
01:49:30,647 --> 01:49:33,983
-路很远，你会饿的。-哦，面包和奶酪
- We got a long ride. You could get hungry.- Oh, bread and cheese!

1036
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:39,446
是的，是面包和奶酪
啊，凯特，他可以从沙漠中找出一顿晚餐来
He could find a lobster dinner in the middle of the desert!

1037
01:49:42,367 --> 01:49:43,701
谢谢
Goodbye.

1038
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,829
-再见。-谢谢
- Take care, Paul.- Bye.

1039
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,921
(Whistle blows)

1040
01:50:15,984 --> 01:50:18,527
画外音：阿尔伯特和我住进了教堂医院
Albert and l are in a Catholic hospital.

1041
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:21,864
我们真是有运气，教堂原是以良好的治疗和食物闻名遐迩
This is a piece of luck because Catholic infirmaries are noted

1042
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,491
良好的治疗和食物闻名遐迩
for their good treatment and good food.

1043
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:29,496
在上火车之前，我们一直坐卡车，我们两个人谁也没有睡好
We were wheeled in the night before and none of us slept well.

1044
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,595
-再也见不到他了。-为什么？
- Won't see him again.- Why not?

1045
01:51:27,305 --> 01:51:30,766
他们拿走他的衣服，说明他去死亡屋了
They've taken his clothes.That means he's off to the Dead Room.

1046
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,394
“死亡屋”什么意思？
The "Dead Room"?

1047
01:51:34,312 --> 01:51:35,521
什么死亡屋？
What's the Dead Room?

1048
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:38,565
是个等死的地方，叫什么都一样
The Dying Room,whatever you wanna call it.

1049
01:51:38,733 --> 01:51:40,943
它是地下室中的一间小屋
It's in the basement.

1050
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:47,116
只要有人想去那儿，想告别人间和生命
Whenever anybody wants to say "goodbye, life", they take 'em there.

1051
01:51:47,283 --> 01:51:51,203
就送他去，那的确很方便，它离太平间很近
It's convenient really.It's next to the mortuary.

1052
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:55,624
没人从那儿走回来
No one ever comes back from it.

1053
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:05,926
画外音：病床空得很快，新的病人又住了进来
The beds empty quickIy and new occupants take their places.

1054
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:11,014
阿尔伯特的情况很不妙，他十分的痛苦
lt is going badly with Albert.He is in much pain.

1055
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:15,102
昨天晚上，我们的一个病友从大失血中醒来
Last night one of our wardmates awakened with a severe haemorrhage.

1056
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:19,982
他今天处于半昏迷状态，医生们更加频繁地进出了
He is only semi-conscious today.The doctors look in more often.

1057
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:47,760
不要动我，不要！不要动我！
(Man) They won't take me! No! No!

1058
01:52:48,636 --> 01:52:50,179
这是送你去换药室
(Nurse) We're taking you to the bandaging room.

1059
01:52:50,346 --> 01:52:53,640
我不要去死亡屋，我要待在这儿，待在这儿
I won't go to the Dying Room!Stay here! Stay here!

1060
01:52:53,808 --> 01:52:56,101
我们送你去换药室
(Nurse) We're going to the bandaging ward.

1061
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:57,770
那你为什么拿他的上衣？
Then why are you taking his tunic?

1062
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:02,232
-我要待在这儿！-那你为什么拿他的上衣？
- I'll be back. I won't die!- Why are you taking his tunic?

1063
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,570、
我要待在这儿
(Man) I'll come back!I won't die! I'll come back!

1064
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:08,113
留下他
Liars!

1065
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,073
你们撒谎
They're lying.

1066
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:12,284
留下
Liars!

1067
01:53:15,538 --> 01:53:20,375
我不想死
(Man) I'll come back!I'll come back! I won't die...

1068
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:26,590

l am learning to walk again but always in the corridor.

1069
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:32,221
l can't bear Albert's gaze if l move abut the room.

1070
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:38,727
He has a strange look. l know what it is because l know Albert.

1071
01:53:38,895 --> 01:53:42,564
He is bitter and jealous that l am getting better and he is not.

1072
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:47,069
And l know he has a terrible guilt that he feeIs jeaIous of me.

1073
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:48,612
l know Albert.

1074
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,405
He's always been my best friend.

1075
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:54,785
l get to know this hospital very well,

1076
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:57,955
where they keep the abdonimal
and spinaI cases,

1077
01:53:58,122 --> 01:54:00,415
the head wounds and double amputations,

1078
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:04,920
the jaw wounds, the tesictle wounds,
the gas cases,

1079
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:06,755
the blind cases,

1080
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:09,925
the lung wounds and intestinal wounds.

1081
01:54:10,093 --> 01:54:13,470
And this is only one hospital.One singIe station.

1082
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,390
There are thousands in Germany.

1083
01:54:16,558 --> 01:54:20,435
How many thousands are there in France?
ln Russia?

1084
01:54:20,603 --> 01:54:22,771
ln England?

1085
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:27,234
How senseless is everything that can ever be written, done and thought,

1086
01:54:27,402 --> 01:54:29,736
when such things are possible?

1087
01:54:29,904 --> 01:54:33,031
The culture of a thousand years could not prevent this stream of blood

1088
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,117
being poured out.

1089
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:38,078
A hospital alone shows what war is.

1090
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:41,081
(Banging and sobbing)

1091
01:54:47,463 --> 01:54:49,298
住手
Stop it!

1092
01:54:49,465 --> 01:54:52,426
你快住手
Stop it! Stop that! Orderly!

1093
01:54:53,052 --> 01:54:54,636
你快住手！医生！
Get the orderly! Doctor!

1094
01:54:54,804 --> 01:54:57,139
医生快来！
Orderly! Orderly!

1095
01:54:57,807 --> 01:55:00,517
他想自杀
He's trying to kill himself with a fork!

1096
01:55:06,816 --> 01:55:08,817
(Hysterical sobbing)

1097
01:55:17,994 --> 01:55:20,662
你干嘛要阻止他？
Why didn't you leave him alone?

1098
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:38,138
你恢复得真好，保罗
You are doing so well, Paul.

1099
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:40,849
不久就不用拐杖了
Soon we'll throw away the cane.

1100
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:48,357
-小姐，-什么事？
- Sister.- Yes?

1101
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,526
我很为我的朋友担心
I'm worried about my friend.

1102
01:55:52,862 --> 01:55:56,865
我想…他正在慢慢顺利地恢复
I think...he is making a very good recovery.

1103
01:55:58,034 --> 01:55:59,952
他让我担心
He worries me.

1104
01:56:00,119 --> 01:56:02,371
手术以后，他…
Since the operation, he...

1105
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:07,042
他神智十分的模糊，甚至不能同我讲话了
He's in a terrible state of mind.He hardly speaks to me any more.

1106
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:12,965
一般情况下，截肢手术以后，常有这种情况
There is always such a reaction after an amputation.

1107
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:15,759
常有的
Always!

1108
01:56:15,927 --> 01:56:18,387
现在，别再担心了
Now, stop worrying.

1109
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,348
阿尔伯特会好起来的
Albert will get over it.

1110
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:24,059
去吧，把你的好消息告诉他
Go, tell him your good news.

1111
01:56:24,894 --> 01:56:26,979
会让他振奋的
That should cheer him up.

1112
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,830
阿尔伯特
Albert?

1113
01:56:45,456 --> 01:56:47,332
你怎么样
How do you feel?

1114
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:07,477
阿尔伯特，他们给了我16天的疗养假期
Albert, they're giving me 16 days' convalescent leave.

1115
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:08,854
我打算回家一趟
I'll be going home.

1116
01:57:11,482 --> 01:57:14,735
他们也会送你回家的
They'll be sending you home, too.Very soon.

1117
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:19,281

Baumer! Hey, Baumer.It's me, I'm back.

1118
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,160
- Franz!
- Didn't I tell you I'd come back?

1119
01:57:23,327 --> 01:57:26,830
- I don't believe it.
- Death Room, Dying Room.

1120
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:30,417
(Coughs) What the...hell
are they talking about?

1121
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,295
Old Man Death didn't catch me.

1122
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:35,630
I caught him out! (Coughs)

1123
01:57:37,925 --> 01:57:39,301
He did say he'd come back.

1124
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,138
Didn't he?

1125
01:57:44,348 --> 01:57:46,308
阿尔伯特，我能帮你做点儿什么吗？
Albert, is there anything I can get you?

1126
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,270
我要把枪
A gun.

1127
01:57:53,816 --> 01:57:55,150
什么？
A what?

1128
01:57:57,945 --> 01:58:01,615
你不是想帮我吗？给我把枪吧
You want to get me something?Get me a gun.

1129
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:10,499
-你能不能给我一把枪？-别这样，不要胡说阿尔伯特
- Are you going to get me a gun or not?- No! Don't talk nonsense!

1130
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:14,336
不，是你在胡说
No, you talk sense.

1131
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:21,593
阿尔伯特
Albert...

1132
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:26,431
对不起
I'm sorry.

1133
01:59:20,862 --> 01:59:22,863
(Baby crying)

1134
02:01:05,132 --> 02:01:07,008
保罗？
Paul?

1135
02:01:07,176 --> 02:01:10,762
保罗，你怎么不告诉我们你要回来？
Paul! Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

1136
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:13,473
妈妈，妈妈
Mother. Mother!

1137
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:22,315
(Sobs)

1138
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:35,912
保罗，上来呀
Paul? Come up.

1139
02:01:55,141 --> 02:01:57,142
把手绢给我用用
Give me your handkerchief.

1140
02:02:16,620 --> 02:02:18,621
妈妈怎么样？
How is she?

1141
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:22,334
噢，她病了
She's in bed.

1142
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:24,502
她在床上，保罗
She's sick, Paul.

1143
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:27,505
什么病？
What is it?

1144
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:29,966
还不清楚
We don't know.

1145
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:36,681
可…布莱顿医生说…这回是癌症
But...Dr Bradermeier thinks...it's probably the cancer again.

1146
02:03:12,968 --> 02:03:15,053
噢，感谢上帝
(Mother) Thank God.

1147
02:03:17,473 --> 02:03:20,016
哦，感谢…
Oh, thank God.

1148
02:03:23,104 --> 02:03:24,771
感谢上帝
Thank God.

1149
02:03:26,816 --> 02:03:28,566
你受伤了吧，保罗？
Are you wounded, Paul?

1150
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:34,531
没有…我没有受伤，我是请假回来的
No... No, I'm just on leave.

1151
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:37,909
-啊…-您身体好吗？
- Oh, Paul.- How are you feeling?

1152
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:42,747
我今天大概都能坐起来了，还行吧
I'm going to try to get up a little today, I think.

1153
02:03:42,915 --> 02:03:44,791
很好
Good.

1154
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:52,090
They must have known you were coming.
Ernst is making your favourite potato cakes.

1155
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:55,635
And there's a bottle of whortleberryjam with them.

1156
02:03:55,803 --> 02:03:59,431
- You like that, don't you?- Yes, I haven't had any for a long time.

1157
02:04:00,975 --> 02:04:02,559
Where's Father?

1158
02:04:04,478 --> 02:04:06,729
At the sulphur factory.

1159
02:04:06,897 --> 02:04:08,565
He's working overtime.

1160
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:20,034
我的孩子，我的保罗
My Paul.

1161
02:04:21,954 --> 02:04:23,288
您看
Look.

1162
02:04:28,377 --> 02:04:30,128
面包
Bread.

1163
02:04:30,921 --> 02:04:34,966
奶酪…黄油
And cheese and...butter!

1164
02:04:36,886 --> 02:04:40,555
有断顿的时候吗，孩子？
They feed you enough where you are?

1165
02:04:40,723 --> 02:04:42,765
不是很经常，但是我们会有办法的
Not always enough, but we manage.

1166
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,394
前线很糟？
Is it very bad there?

1167
02:04:48,439 --> 02:04:49,647
不
No.

1168
02:04:49,815 --> 02:04:51,816
不是很糟
Not so bad.

1169
02:04:53,068 --> 02:04:54,944
海因里希·布莱顿医生来过
Heinrich Bradermeier was here

1170
02:04:55,112 --> 02:05:00,909
他说前线那儿很糟，他们放毒气
and said it's terrible out there,with the gas attacks

1171
02:05:01,076 --> 02:05:03,119
还有别的武器
and all the rest of it.

1172
02:05:03,287 --> 02:05:04,829
这些都是传说妈妈
It's just talk.

1173
02:05:04,997 --> 02:05:06,915
只是传说
Just talk.

1174
02:05:07,082 --> 02:05:10,502
你看我，挺好的是吗？
Look at me, I'm well and fit,aren't I?

1175
02:05:10,669 --> 02:05:12,003



1176
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,341
是的
Yes.

1177
02:05:22,932 --> 02:05:24,933
那就好
But then...

1178
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,814
我始终不理解你为什么要脱去军装
I still don't understand why you want to take off your uniform.

1179
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:35,360
这样只是略微舒服一些，爸爸。没什么
It's just more comfortable,Father, that's all.

1180
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:38,530
可是…可我还准备向别人夸耀说
But I...I want to show off our soldier boy

1181
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:40,740
我有个当兵的儿子
to the fellows at Max's.

1182
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:59,509
你气色不错，保罗，战争很适合你啊，嗯？
You look well, Paul. Fit.War agrees with you, eh?

1183
02:06:01,178 --> 02:06:02,929
也许是吧，哲尔先生
I suppose, in a way.

1184
02:06:03,097 --> 02:06:04,305
-来支雪茄吧。-哦不，谢谢
- Have a cigar.- No, thank you.

1185
02:06:04,473 --> 02:06:08,601
你这年龄都能杀法国人了，抽支烟还算什么
If you're old enough to kill Frenchmen,you're old enough to smoke.

1186
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,438
汉斯，给年轻的战士来杯啤酒
Hans, another beer for our young warrior.

1187
02:06:12,606 --> 02:06:15,608
前线的士气怎么样？非常高昂吗，啊？
What's the spirit like out there?Excellent, eh?

1188
02:06:16,527 --> 02:06:20,029
我想要做的是，把法国人全都收拾了
I can believe it. The thing to do now is finish off the Froggies.

1189
02:06:20,197 --> 02:06:23,700
敌人有很强的战斗力，霍勒斯坦先生
The enemy has many reserves,Mr Hollerstein.

1190
02:06:23,867 --> 02:06:26,953
这场战争和人们想的有点儿不太一样
The war may be different from what people think.

1191
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:29,872
你只说对了一半儿，保罗
You only see your little sector,

1192
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,959
你只看到了一部分，有时候你忽略了对全局的把握
sometimes you lose sight of the large picture.

1193
02:06:33,127 --> 02:06:39,632
我认为你应当突破它们。这是弗兰德斯
The important thing as I see it is the breakthrough, here in Flanders.

1194
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,509
这是法国人；还有这个呢，是我们
This is Frenchie, this is us.

1195
02:06:41,677 --> 02:06:46,639
我们应该从比利时一侧绕过去突破它们的防线
We have to come round the Belgian side and ram through.

1196
02:06:46,807 --> 02:06:48,099
此外，别无选择
There's no other way.

1197
02:06:48,601 --> 02:06:52,186
在辛德堡防线不先打败它们，你怎么绕过去？
How can we do that before we beat them on the Hindenburg line?

1198
02:06:52,354 --> 02:06:54,981
国界在战争中最为重要
It is borders that are important.

1199
02:06:55,149 --> 02:06:59,360
你完全错了，鲍勃。
一个优秀的士兵决不能像萝卜那样待在国界上
You're quite wrong.
A good soldier never stays planted on a border like a turnip.

1200
02:06:59,528 --> 02:07:01,779
-他要前进。-我赞成路德维柯
- He advances.- I agree with Ludwig.

1201
02:07:01,947 --> 02:07:05,700
进攻是现代战争的灵魂，看看1870年的战争吧
Offence is the key to modern warfare.Look what happened in 1870.

1202
02:07:05,868 --> 02:07:11,789
胡说，哲尔。我们在讨论现代战争，而不是50年前的事情
Nonsense. We're talking about modern warfare, not what happened 50 years ago.

1203
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:18,379
你没讲实话，保罗，我知道你在说谎
You're lying to me, Paul.I know that you are.

1204
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:21,966
我发誓，他当时就死了
I swear to you, he died instantly.

1205
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:26,763
-你保证说，他不会受伤的。-堪布里希，我当时什么也…
- You promised me he wouldn't get hurt.- Mrs Kemmerich, I...

1206
02:07:26,930 --> 02:07:30,892
他死了为什么你还活着？为什么？
Why are you living when he is dead? Why?

1207
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:33,227
你有什么权利
What right have you?

1208
02:07:51,955 --> 02:07:54,332
再说一遍
Tell me again.

1209
02:07:56,543 --> 02:07:58,753
你看到他死了？
Did you...see it?

1210
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:02,590
是的，我当时就在他身边
Yes, I was right there next to him.

1211
02:08:03,592 --> 02:08:06,260
他死得很快，毫无痛苦
He died at once. He never suffered.

1212
02:08:11,183 --> 02:08:15,853
我知道你想要安慰我
I know that you're trying to comfort me,

1213
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:20,942
但这样更让人痛苦，比讲实话还痛苦
but don't you see it is harder this way than if you told the truth?

1214
02:08:23,612 --> 02:08:25,113
我要知道事情真相
I want to know the...

1215
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,574
我要真相
(Sobbing) I want the truth!

1216
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:32,787
我要亲耳听到
I have to hear it!

1217
02:08:35,124 --> 02:08:38,793
堪布里希夫人，我发誓，我说的全部是事实
Mrs Kemmerich, I promise you,that's exactly how it happened.

1218
02:08:39,294 --> 02:08:43,673
他但是就死了，什么痛苦的感觉也没有
He died immediately.He felt absolutely nothing at all.

1219
02:08:45,592 --> 02:08:47,260
他的表情十分的平静
His face was quite calm.

1220
02:08:48,762 --> 02:08:51,180
-你发誓吗？-是的
- Do you swear it?- Yes.

1221
02:08:52,975 --> 02:08:55,768
为1000多的人发誓？
By everything that is sacred to you?

1222
02:09:03,485 --> 02:09:06,070
为异国的全部的人发誓
By everything that is sacred to me.

1223
02:09:07,114 --> 02:09:08,448
他当时就死了
He died at once.

1224
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:15,371
如果这不是真的，你发誓不再回来了
And do you promise never to come back...if it is not true?

1225
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,676
如果我说了谎
May I never come back...

1226
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:32,180
我就再也不回来了
if he wasn't killed instantly.

1227
02:09:39,021 --> 02:09:40,980
把你们学到的带到前线去
Carry that lesson to the front lines

1228
02:09:41,148 --> 02:09:45,109
你们将成为优秀的士兵，为皇帝战斗
and you will be better soldiers in the service of the Kaiser.

1229
02:09:46,945 --> 02:09:48,696
现在下课
You are dismissed.

1230
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:13,179
鲍曼
Baumer.

1231
02:10:16,308 --> 02:10:18,226
保罗·鲍曼
Paul Baumer!

1232
02:10:20,562 --> 02:10:22,438
鲍曼
Baumer!

1233
02:10:24,024 --> 02:10:27,401
-来支香烟吧。-不，谢谢
- Here, have a cigarette.- No, thank you.

1234
02:10:27,569 --> 02:10:30,780
瞧你还没改掉这个习惯，这很好，这不是什么好习惯
You still haven't picked up the habit.Well, that's good.

1235
02:10:30,948 --> 02:10:36,077
人总是有些坏毛病的吧？啊？
It's not a good habit but a man has to have some vices.

1236
02:10:36,245 --> 02:10:39,831
你还是只有工作，没有娱乐…还记得吗？
How does it go? All work and no play... You remember?

1237
02:10:39,998 --> 02:10:42,250
是的
(Coughs) Yes...

1238
02:10:42,417 --> 02:10:47,046
我说，怎么样？鲍曼？士气，士气怎么样？鲍曼？
How is it, Baumer?How...how is the spirit?

1239
02:10:47,923 --> 02:10:49,423
士气，士气很高昂，是吧？
Excellent, eh? Excellent?

1240
02:10:51,218 --> 02:10:53,135
贝母死了
Behm is dead.

1241
02:10:53,303 --> 02:10:54,929
贝母？
Behm?

1242
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:56,681
约瑟夫·贝母
Josef Behm.

1243
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:59,934
哦，你知道，我认为他不该入伍
Oh. You know,I didn't think he would enlist.

1244
02:11:00,978 --> 02:11:02,645
可他去了
But he went.

1245
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:05,439
是啊
Yes...

1246
02:11:05,607 --> 02:11:08,067
堪布里希也死了
Kemmerich is dead, too.

1247
02:11:08,235 --> 02:11:09,735
啊，有人告诉我了
I was told.

1248
02:11:09,903 --> 02:11:12,488
还有克洛普丢了一条腿
And Kropp has lost a leg.

1249
02:11:13,323 --> 02:11:15,950
哦……噢，阿尔伯特·克洛普
Er... Oh, Albert Kropp, yes.

1250
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:23,124
其他人我不太清楚，我们很早就分开了。不过里尔还在
I don't know about all the others.We were separated, but Leer's alive

1251
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:26,168
缪勒活着，我们也活着
and Müller is alive and I'm alive.

1252
02:11:27,212 --> 02:11:28,880
真让人高兴
I'm glad to hear that.

1253
02:11:30,966 --> 02:11:33,301
告诉他们
(Chuckles) Tell them...

1254
02:11:33,468 --> 02:11:38,973
转告他们我很自豪，把他们培养成为优秀的德国人
Tell them I'm proud to have taught them to be good Germans.

1255
02:11:40,309 --> 02:11:44,937
我为你们为祖国付出的一切而感到自豪
To know that you have all done your duty by the Fatherland.

1256
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:50,109
你能想象到我有多高兴
Can you imagine how that makes me feel?

1257
02:11:51,653 --> 02:11:54,822
你们这个班很好，都是好孩子
You were a good class. Good boys.

1258
02:11:55,824 --> 02:11:58,326
祖国的优秀儿女
Good boys all.

1259
02:11:58,493 --> 02:12:01,329
-现在这个班呢？-哼，这个班？
- And this class?- This lot? (Laughs)

1260
02:12:01,496 --> 02:12:06,334
不一样。失败主义传染了他们
Not like you. Defeatism,it has infected them.

1261
02:12:08,086 --> 02:12:10,296
他们没你们的精神，鲍曼
They haven't got your spirit, Baumer.

1262
02:12:11,256 --> 02:12:13,341
不再是坚强的青年了，嗯？
Not the Iron Youth, eh?

1263
02:12:13,508 --> 02:12:14,717
什么？嗯？
Mm? I'm sorry...?

1264
02:12:14,885 --> 02:12:16,886
你的坚强青年
No Iron Heroes?

1265
02:12:17,596 --> 02:12:19,513
他们只是孩子
Just boys.

1266
02:12:20,182 --> 02:12:22,099
还要玩耍
Want to play.

1267
02:12:22,267 --> 02:12:24,101
嬉笑
Laugh.

1268
02:12:24,895 --> 02:12:26,228
想活着
To stay alive.

1269
02:12:29,733 --> 02:12:31,734
他们还只是孩子
Only boys.

1270
02:12:48,794 --> 02:12:50,920
(Footsteps outside)

1271
02:13:15,153 --> 02:13:17,863
妈妈，很晚了，你该去睡觉了
Mother, it's late.You should be asleep.

1272
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:20,658
想和你多待一会儿，对不起
Did I wake you, dear? I'm sorry.

1273
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:23,411
你要着凉的，去睡吧妈妈
You'll catch cold here. Go, sleep.

1274
02:13:24,454 --> 02:13:26,163
我实在睡不着
I can sleep enough later.

1275
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:30,584
你在那边害怕吗？
Are you very much afraid?

1276
02:13:33,255 --> 02:13:34,547
不
No.

1277
02:13:34,715 --> 02:13:40,594
我想提醒你，你一定要时刻提防一些法国女人
I'd like to tell you to be on your guard against the women in France.

1278
02:13:40,762 --> 02:13:42,555
他们没有那么好
They're no good.

1279
02:13:44,766 --> 02:13:49,103
妈妈，在我们那里，一个女人也没有
Mother, where we are there aren't any women.

1280
02:13:49,271 --> 02:13:52,773
在前线一定要小心呐保罗
And be very careful at the front, Paul.

1281
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:57,319
-是的，一定。-我每天都在为你祈祷
- Yes, I will.- I pray for you every day.

1282
02:13:58,363 --> 02:14:00,364
我知道，妈妈
I know, Mother.

1283
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:05,786
也许，你可以找到一份安稳的事情做
Perhaps you can get a job that is not so dangerous?

1284
02:14:07,122 --> 02:14:10,458
是，也许我应该去炊事班，这很容易做到，妈妈
Yes, perhaps in the cookhouse.That could be easily done.

1285
02:14:10,959 --> 02:14:14,295
那你就去吧，如果别人说起…
You do it, then,and if the others say anything...

1286
02:14:14,463 --> 02:14:16,338
我不怕别人说什么
I won't let that bother me.

1287
02:14:16,506 --> 02:14:21,469
现在，您应该去睡觉了，妈妈。去吧，来
Now, you must go to sleep, Mother.Come on.

1288
02:14:51,625 --> 02:14:55,377
You must get well, Mother,before I come home.

1289
02:14:56,463 --> 02:14:58,506
Yes, my child.

1290
02:14:59,758 --> 02:15:03,928
And you must not send any more things to me.
We get plenty to eat out there.

1291
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:07,515
You can make much better use of them here.

1292
02:15:19,653 --> 02:15:22,696
Oh, I have two pair of underpants for you.

1293
02:15:22,864 --> 02:15:24,865
All wool.

1294
02:15:26,535 --> 02:15:28,869
They will keep you warm.

1295
02:15:29,037 --> 02:15:31,497
You must not forget to put them in your bag.

1296
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,209
I won't, Mother.

1297
02:15:35,377 --> 02:15:40,005
Good night.

1298
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:41,882
My son.

1299
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:25,402
妈妈，我过去一直住在这屋里，我的一切都在这儿
Mother, l used to live in this room.All my things are here.

1300
02:17:25,570 --> 02:17:28,948
所有的书，所有我珍爱的书
All my books, my beloved books,

1301
02:17:29,115 --> 02:17:32,117
可是他们不再像从前那样对我诉说了
but they no longer speak to me as they used to,

1302
02:17:32,285 --> 02:17:35,746
因为现在的我已经不是当时住在这里的我了
for l am not what l was when l lived in this room.

1303
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:41,961
我现在是士兵，我的事业不再是读书，而是杀戮
l am a soldier. My business is not reading, it is killing.

1304
02:17:42,128 --> 02:17:45,130
我对生命的知识仅限于死
My knowledge of life is limited to death,

1305
02:17:45,298 --> 02:17:48,175
我知道，我不该再回来
and l know now l should never have come back.

1306
02:17:49,219 --> 02:17:51,637
外面的人们和我一样想
Out there, all men think as l do.

1307
02:17:51,805 --> 02:17:53,806
没有必要争论生命的意义
There's no argument about the meaning of life,

1308
02:17:53,974 --> 02:17:56,100
因为它本无意义
because it has no meaning.

1309
02:17:56,268 --> 02:18:00,104
我只知道我的同伴正在前线
My companions at the front are the only truth l know.

1310
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:04,108
他们不是我的书籍、家庭和生命
They are now my books,my family, my life.

1311
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:08,153
但我需要他们，我不再需要别的什么
l depend on them and l depend on nothing else.

1312
02:18:09,406 --> 02:18:12,866
妈妈，说这些话很可怕
Mother, it's a terrible thing to say,

1313
02:18:13,868 --> 02:18:16,704
但我感觉我现在该去找我真正的归宿了
but l feel l am now going back to my reaI home.

1314
02:18:36,266 --> 02:18:42,474
-保罗。-快快，快下车
(Kat) Paul!

1315
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:52,740
-好啊，你回来了。-是的，我回来了
- Well, you're back, my boy.- Yes, I'm back.

1316
02:18:56,036 --> 02:18:59,413
傻瓜才不回来呢，回来我很高兴，保罗
You're a fool for coming back.I'm glad to see you, anyway.

1317
02:18:59,581 --> 02:19:01,874
我也很高兴，凯特
I'm glad to see you, too, Kat.

1318
02:19:05,253 --> 02:19:07,880
他们送来了更加年轻的
They're getting younger and younger, Paul.

1319
02:19:11,593 --> 02:19:14,720
光照顾他们就够咱们受的
Our hands'll be full just taking care of them.

1320
02:19:23,772 --> 02:19:26,565
嗨！啊～～老逃兵回来啦
Hey! The old deserter's back!

1321
02:19:26,733 --> 02:19:29,443
(Welcoming shouts)

1322
02:19:29,611 --> 02:19:32,029
-嘿，保罗，你好啊？-很好，缪勒呢？
- How was your leave?- Good. Where's Müller?

1323
02:19:38,286 --> 02:19:41,246
-什么时候？-一周以前
- When was it?- A week ago.

1324
02:19:45,752 --> 02:19:47,795
死得快吗？
Was it quick?

1325
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:55,803
弹片击中了他的腹部，躺了两个小时
Shrapnel in the stomach.He lasted two hours.

1326
02:20:00,141 --> 02:20:02,059
Paul...

1327
02:20:03,812 --> 02:20:05,813
He said I could have them.

1328
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,321
(Gunfire and explosions)

1329
02:20:20,328 --> 02:20:21,995
混账
Damn!

1330
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:33,173
等他们再近一点，我们先开火
If they come any closer,we're done for.

1331
02:20:42,183 --> 02:21:13,797
队长
Lieutenant!

1332
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:17,885
-里尔！-别管他，他完了！快回来
(Paul) Leer! No, leave him!He's gone! He's gone!

1333
02:21:18,052 --> 02:21:20,053
回来！里尔
Leer! Come back!

1334
02:21:36,863 --> 02:21:38,197
里尔！
God!

1335
02:21:38,823 --> 02:21:42,075
噢，上帝呀！
Oh, God! God! God! God!

1336
02:21:42,243 --> 02:21:44,578
(Sobbing)

1337
02:22:03,681 --> 02:22:06,308
(Explosion and screams)

1338
02:22:31,417 --> 02:22:33,502
-冲啊！杀呀！-冲啊！
- Ready! Charge!- Let's go!

1339
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:35,712
(Gunfire and explosions)

1340
02:22:37,799 --> 02:22:40,300
(Shouting and screaming)

1341
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:58,819
画外音：我们给前线的战友们运送食物
We are bringing food to our comrades at the front.

1342
02:22:58,987 --> 02:23:03,448
前面食物紧缺，我们都饿得发慌，精疲力尽…
There isn't much. We are all going hungry. We are all tired.

1343
02:23:03,616 --> 02:23:07,494
一片茫然，然而，仗还在打
We are all hopeless.But the war goes on.

1344
02:23:10,748 --> 02:23:12,457
他们为什么不结束战争啊？
Why don't theyjust let it end?

1345
02:23:12,625 --> 02:23:14,543
哦，谁知道呢
Ah, who knows?

1346
02:23:17,755 --> 02:23:19,506
快完了
We're finished.

1347
02:23:19,674 --> 02:23:24,344
饿得要死，而法国人正在吃鲜牛肉和白面包
We're starving, and the Froggies are eating corned beef and white bread.

1348
02:23:25,763 --> 02:23:27,681
我们只有面包渣了，该死
Our bread is nothing but sawdust.

1349
02:23:30,518 --> 02:23:33,854
你看见有谁不得痢疾和肚子疼呢？
You see anybody that hasn't got dysentery and colic?

1350
02:23:35,565 --> 02:23:37,232
大炮被烧坏了
Artillery's burned out.

1351
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:41,403
枪把‘儿又磨掉了…
Damned barrels are so worn down... Ha!

1352
02:23:41,571 --> 02:23:45,699
炮弹也飞不远了，炸死了我们自己的人
..the shells are falling short and half the time our men are being killed.

1353
02:23:45,867 --> 02:23:50,662
可是我们现在呢，没有一匹马。可是敌人呢，却越来越多
There's just too many of the enemy left.They've got too much.

1354
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:54,541
他们太强大了，那么多的机枪、坦克，美国人也卷入战争
Too many guns, tanks.Now the Americans are pouring in.

1355
02:23:56,252 --> 02:24:00,380
新式机枪、飞机，兵员不断
New guns, aeroplanes, fresh troops.

1356
02:24:03,468 --> 02:24:05,385
(Shells whistling)

1357
02:24:10,308 --> 02:24:12,434
(Kat groans)

1358
02:24:18,733 --> 02:24:20,400
躺着别动
Lie still.

1359
02:24:21,235 --> 02:24:23,987
-眼看着要结束了，快要结束了！-别说话
- Just as it's ending!- Be quiet!

1360
02:24:24,155 --> 02:24:27,366
-4年过去了。-救护员！
- After four years.- Stretcher!

1361
02:24:27,950 --> 02:24:30,577
-救护员！-快要结束了
- Stretcher bearer!- Just as it's ending.

1362
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:34,081
你会好的，别紧张
It's all right. Just lie still.

1363
02:24:34,248 --> 02:24:37,417
没关系，伤口不严重
Don't worry,it looks like a clean wound.

1364
02:24:38,294 --> 02:24:40,545
你只要坚持一会儿
If you can just hold on.

1365
02:24:40,713 --> 02:24:44,424
再坚持一会儿就躺在床上了，医院的床上
Before you know it you'll be in a comfortable bed in a hospital.

1366
02:24:45,426 --> 02:24:47,260
救护员！
Stretcher!

1367
02:24:47,428 --> 02:24:48,637
你能站起来吗？
Think you can stand up?

1368
02:24:49,931 --> 02:24:50,931
来吧，我们试试，来
Think you can get up?

1369
02:24:52,266 --> 02:24:55,268
走，我们走
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1370
02:25:03,945 --> 02:25:05,612
不行。来吧，我背你走
I've got to carry you.

1371
02:25:06,656 --> 02:25:08,532
我们走
Ready? Up.

1372
02:25:31,639 --> 02:25:32,514
对不起
I'm sorry.

1373
02:25:32,682 --> 02:25:35,350
没关系，保罗，没关系
That's all right, Paul. That's all right.

1374
02:25:40,027 --> 02:25:43,071
我们得赶紧走，你能行吗？
We gotta keep going. You ready?

1375
02:25:43,239 --> 02:25:49,823
是的，我能行
Yes, yes.

1376
02:25:51,743 --> 02:25:53,493
我们走
Come on.

1377
02:25:57,498 --> 02:25:59,666
-行吗？-我试试
- You got it?- I'll try.

1378
02:26:04,505 --> 02:26:05,672
-我试试，-算了凯特，我背你走
- No.- No, I'll try.

1379
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,258
来吧，我们走
No, you can't. It's all right.

1380
02:26:12,805 --> 02:26:14,139
(Shells whistling)

1381
02:26:41,626 --> 02:26:44,044
- What is it?- My pipe.

1382
02:26:44,837 --> 02:26:46,630
I think I've lost my pipe.

1383
02:26:46,798 --> 02:26:48,465
Don't worry.

1384
02:26:48,633 --> 02:26:50,467
We'll find another one.

1385
02:26:51,511 --> 02:26:53,595
- Here.- (Loud explosion)

1386
02:27:09,445 --> 02:27:11,822
Well, Kat...

1387
02:27:13,115 --> 02:27:15,242
I think we're gonna be separated.

1388
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:19,412
Three years.

1389
02:27:22,792 --> 02:27:25,085
You remember when I first came up here?

1390
02:27:25,753 --> 02:27:27,921
How green I was?

1391
02:27:29,465 --> 02:27:32,592
You fixed that. "Keep your head down."

1392
02:27:33,636 --> 02:27:35,387
That's what you said.

1393
02:27:39,892 --> 02:27:44,771
Maybe... Maybe, when this is over,

1394
02:27:45,606 --> 02:27:49,276
when this war is really finished,

1395
02:27:49,443 --> 02:27:52,821
maybe we can do something together. Huh?

1396
02:27:52,989 --> 02:27:55,031
- (Explosion)- I don't know what.

1397
02:27:56,325 --> 02:27:57,909
Glass of wine.

1398
02:28:00,955 --> 02:28:03,039
I don't even know where you live.

1399
02:28:03,666 --> 02:28:07,627
Three years in the same trenches,I don't even have your address.

1400
02:28:08,004 --> 02:28:10,881
Let me give you mine. Let me give it to you.

1401
02:28:13,759 --> 02:28:15,135
Let's...

1402
02:28:16,137 --> 02:28:17,971
Let's go on.

1403
02:28:20,182 --> 02:28:22,893
- Come on. Ready?- Yeah.

1404
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:24,978
Come on!

1405
02:28:28,649 --> 02:28:29,983
(Straining)

1406
02:28:30,151 --> 02:28:32,485
(Shells whistling)

1407
02:29:25,665 --> 02:29:30,752
你早该放下他了，他已经僵死了
(Doctor) You might have spared yourself. Stone dead.

1408
02:29:36,133 --> 02:29:37,801
不
No.

1409
02:29:39,470 --> 02:29:43,932
他伤了小腿，只是昏迷
It's his shin, he's fainted.

1410
02:29:45,768 --> 02:29:48,061
来吧凯特，醒醒！
Come on, Kat, come on.

1411
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:11,710
他一直在说话
He was talking.

1412
02:30:16,424 --> 02:30:18,550
10分钟以前
Ten minutes ago.

1413
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:26,057
我们…还在说话
We were talking.

1414
02:30:49,957 --> 02:30:53,418
画外音：秋天来了，我们盼望着结束
lt is autumn.We wait for the end.

1415
02:30:54,628 --> 02:30:56,546
我们等待着休战
We wait for the Armistice.

1416
02:30:57,465 --> 02:30:59,466
渴望着和平
We wait for peace.

1417
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:13,438
亲爱的阿尔伯特，我写信告诉你说，我俩是幸存的人了
Dear Albert, l write to tell you you and l are the last ones left.

1418
02:31:14,982 --> 02:31:20,320
凯特死后不久，夏登也死了，他死得迅速而幸福
Soon after Kat died, Tjaden got it a quick and merciful death,

1419
02:31:20,488 --> 02:31:22,197
子弹穿过脑颅
a bullet in the head.

1420
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:25,241
西摩尔斯托斯死于同一天
Himmelstoss was killed the same day

1421
02:31:25,409 --> 02:31:27,744
现在，德特林也不在了
and now Detering is gone.

1422
02:31:30,331 --> 02:31:33,666
好像去年春天起，德特林就不知道去哪儿了
l think we started to lose Detering last spring,

1423
02:31:33,834 --> 02:31:36,336
那正是苹果花盛开的时候
when the apple trees came into bloom.

1424
02:31:37,004 --> 02:31:39,964
你知道，这是他描述春天的词句
You know that expression of his in springtime?

1425
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:45,011
两星期前点名时想起了他，哪儿都没有他
Two weeks ago he was missed at roll-call, nowhere to be found.

1426
02:31:45,846 --> 02:31:49,307
一周后，我们听说他被宪兵找到了
A week later we heard he had been caught by the MiIitary PoIice.

1427
02:31:49,475 --> 02:31:54,813
你我都清楚会在哪里。在家里，收获的地方
You and l know where he was going.Home, to the harvest.

1428
02:31:54,980 --> 02:31:58,858
此后就再也没有他的消息了，你知道逃兵会有什么下场
We have not heard anything more,but you know the penalty for desertion.

1429
02:32:00,861 --> 02:32:03,947
阿尔伯特，我们1916班
Albert, of the class of 1916,

1430
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:08,368
总共20名报名参军的人，13名死去了
out of the 20 who enlisted,13 are dead.

1431
02:32:08,953 --> 02:32:11,204
4个人失踪
Four are missing.

1432
02:32:11,956 --> 02:32:14,374
1个在疯人院
One is in a madhouse.

1433
02:32:15,334 --> 02:32:17,710
只有你和我还活着
You and l live.

1434
02:32:17,878 --> 02:32:19,796
我是多么的想念你呀
How I miss you.

1435
02:32:22,550 --> 02:33:22,942
(Gunshot)

1436
02:33:39,126 --> 02:33:41,002
(Bird sings)

1437
02:33:58,145 --> 02:34:00,396
(Birdsong continues)
